## Description

Wagg.ly is a proof of concept service that allows you to connect dogs with walkers. 
It's written entirely using AWS Amplify, providing a serverless backend to a Next.js 
frontend application.

## Getting started

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
You neeed the AWS Amplify CLI installed to run the project locally. 
To do this, run `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli` and then `amplify configure` to set up your AWS account.

## Running the project
Running the project is as pulling any changes from Amplify with `amplify pull`, and then running `npm run dev` to start the Next.js server.
